[Pool](https://www.pooldata.io/)

### Description

Pool’s purpose is to redistribute power, value and control in the data economy. Pool’s platform supports organizations called Data Unions, who enable ordinary people to monetize and share their data. Because those people are positively engaged in sharing their information, data products on Pool’s platform are richer, more relevant, and far easier to license.
