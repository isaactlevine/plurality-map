### Works On

Founded in Taiwan, "g0v" is a decentralized civic tech community focused on information transparency, open results, and open cooperation. The movement began in late 2012, initiated by [[CL Kao]], ipa, and Kirby, inspired by the need for better government transparency and citizen participation. g0v operates primarily through bimonthly hackathons where participants propose projects and collaborate to develop solutions. The community embraces a grassroots approach, encouraging contributions from individuals with diverse backgrounds, not just software engineers.

g0v originated from the Occupy movement, aiming to provide a platform for civic engagement and government transparency. The community gained attention with projects like the Real-Price Maps, which offered a more accessible view of real estate transactions than the government's own platform. Over time, g0v has grown to include over 8,000 participants worldwide. g0v operates both online and offline, with hackathons being a central activity. These events allow participants to propose and work on various projects, often continuing their collaboration outside of the hackathons. The projects typically use open-source code and licenses, fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration.

Key projects include Hackfoldr, Cofacts LINE Bot, Government Budget Visualization, and Moedict. Each project leverages open-source tools to address civic issues, making data and resources more accessible to the public. The community also supports initiatives like the g0v Civic Tech Prototype Grant, which funds innovative civic tech projects.
