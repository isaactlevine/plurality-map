### Works On

John W. Etchemendy's research focuses on logic, semantics, and the philosophy of language. He challenges orthodox views on the central notions of truth, logical consequence, and logical truth. His work also explores the role of diagrams and nonlinguistic forms of representation in reasoning. Etchemendy has developed several pieces of instructional software, including Turing's World, Tarski's World, Fitch, and Hyperproof, which support the reasoning process.
