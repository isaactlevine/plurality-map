### Description

Constructive communication refers to communication practices and technologies designed to enhance understanding, facilitate consensus-building, and promote collaboration across diverse perspectives. It aims to move beyond traditional information exchange to foster deeper comprehension, shared meaning-making, and the identification of common ground amidst differences. Examples of constructive communication include augmented deliberation platforms like vTaiwan and Polis, which use clustering algorithms to map diverse viewpoints and highlight areas of agreement, as well as "bridging systems" that help users navigate complex conversations by focusing on shared values.
