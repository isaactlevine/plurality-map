### Description

Bridging systems aim to reduce societal divisiveness by fostering mutual understanding and trust across divides, facilitating productive conflict, deliberation, or cooperation. These systems operate across various domains, including social media recommender systems, civic forums, and human-facilitated group deliberation. By reframing attention-allocation as a key factor in divisiveness, bridging systems seek to implement algorithms and processes that prioritize cross-cutting interactions and depolarization.
