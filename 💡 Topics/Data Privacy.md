### Description

Most data do not pertain solely to a single individual, challenging the notion that data privacy can be managed through individual control and consent alone. Data is inherently social and relational, stemming from interactions and shared experiences. Disclosing one person's data can inadvertently reveal information about others connected to them, such as family members or individuals within a particular community. 

A related concept, "contextual integrity" ensures that information remains within the appropriate social context for which it was intended, recognizing that data should be shared and understood within specific communities while safeguarding against inappropriate disclosure outside those boundaries. Achieving contextual integrity requires moving beyond traditional cryptographic techniques and regulations that primarily focus on protecting individual privacy. Instead, it calls for mechanisms that protect against the risks of oversharing within groups and establish clear boundaries for data flow between different social contexts.

Various technological and social mechanisms can support contextual integrity, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Secure Multi-Party Computation, Homomorphic Encryption, Differential Privacy, and the formation of "data trusts" or "mediators of individual data" (MIDs).
