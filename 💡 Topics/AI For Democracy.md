### Description

AI for democracy can be understood as the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies to promote democratic values and improve democratic processes. This includes, but is not limited to, using AI to make government more responsive and accessible, facilitate more inclusive and informed public deliberations, and ensure that technological advancements empower rather than undermine democratic societies.

Examples:

Adaptive administration refers to the use generative foundation models to improve the efficiency, fairness, and cultural sensitivity of bureaucratic systems. GFMs can learn complex rules and processes, translate between languages, and adapt to diverse cultural values, potentially making public services more accessible and responsive to the needs of all citizens. For example, GFMs could enable a citizen to interact with government services in their native language, even if the official forms and information are only available in a different language.

Augmented deliberation refers to the use of AI to facilitate more constructive and inclusive public conversations. Platforms like Polis use machine learning to identify and highlight diverse perspectives within large-scale online discussions, helping participants understand the contours of a debate and find areas of agreement.
